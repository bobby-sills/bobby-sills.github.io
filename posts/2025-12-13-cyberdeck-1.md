Pictured above is the Play Piper, a kit for kids to play around with coding. One of my friends got it as a gift a while ago, but he had never opened it and offered it to me when he was moving. It sat untouched on my shelf for a couple months before I finally opened it up to see what it could do. It comes preinstalled with a modified version of the Raspberry Pi OS, and runs a dumbed down version of Minecraft on boot by default.

Ever since seeing Cyberdecks online, I wanted to build one myself. This kit was honestly perfect. It had everything already included (that I got for free\!); the batteries, display, speakers, casing, and computer. At first I attempted to install Arch from a USB stick, but I didn’t know that you can’t install regular Arch Linux on an ARM architecture. After a bit of troubleshooting, I realized it would be much easier to launch it directly from the SD card that held the PiperOS. I tried to install it via the official website’s instructions, manualling formatting my SD card, but it didn’t boot. Huge thanks to [wrzlbrmft](https://github.com/wrzlbrmft/arch-pi) for the install script that actually worked. For this project, I really wanted to see if I could make the most of the tty and try to “rice” it as much as possible, like [this](https://old.reddit.com/r/unixporn/comments/7cap00/ttytmux_gruvbox_color_scheme/). Though honestly, I was kind of surprised at the lack of customization for the tty. I’m used to using TUIs with nerdfonts and all of that fancy terminal stuff, but tty doesn’t support any of that. I’m still not exactly sure what I want to use this cyberdeck for. I might use it for coding (though the screen is a little tiny). Or maybe a home server that could host this website. I was also thinking it could be a wall mounted piece that displays stats, things like weather, recent headlines, and music. But right now I’m just focused on getting a functioning computer.
